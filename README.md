Credit Score Prediction App
This repository contains the JavaFX application for a credit score prediction system. The application uses a trained K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict a user's credit score based on their financial information.

Features:

User Authentication: Secure login and signup functionality to manage user accounts.
Credit Score Prediction: Predicts credit score based on user input using a trained KNN model.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive JavaFX GUI for easy data input and result visualization.
Credit Score Distribution Visualization: Displays a pie chart showcasing the distribution of credit score categories.
Help and Instructions: Provides readily accessible guidance on how to use the application.
Technologies:

JavaFX: The user interface is built using the JavaFX library, providing a rich and interactive experience.
Weka: The application leverages the Weka machine learning library for model training and prediction.
KNN: The credit score prediction is based on the KNN algorithm, a popular and effective classification method.
How It Works:

Training: The KNN model is trained on a dataset containing historical credit data and corresponding credit score categories.
Prediction: When a user provides their financial information, the app creates a new data instance and uses the trained KNN model to predict their credit score category.
Visualization: The predicted credit score category is displayed to the user, and a pie chart provides a visual representation of the overall credit score distribution.
Getting Started:

Clone the repository:

bash

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CreditScoreApp.git
Install JavaFX:

Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
Download the JavaFX SDK from https://openjfx.io/.
Add the JavaFX libraries to your project's build path (refer to your IDE's instructions).
Set up Data and Model:

Dataset: Place your preprocessed credit score dataset (CSV format) named final_dataset.csv in the root directory of the project.
Model: Create a KNN model named knn_model.model (using Weka) and place it in the root directory. You can train the model using Weka.
User Data: Create a file named userdata.txt in the root directory to store usernames and passwords.
Run the Application:

Compile and run the HomePage.java file using your preferred IDE.
The application will launch and display the login/signup screen.
Structure:

HomePage.java: Contains the main application logic, user authentication, and navigation.
CreditScoringUI.java: Handles the user interface, input data collection, prediction request, and result display.
CreditScoringModel.java: Contains the code for loading, training, and using the KNN model for prediction.
Potential Improvements:

User Profile: Allow users to save their profiles for faster prediction input.
Advanced Visualization: Explore more informative charts and visualizations for credit score distribution.
Model Evaluation: Implement metrics to evaluate the performance of the KNN model.
Enhanced User Experience: Add error handling and feedback messages for better user interaction.
Data Privacy: Implement secure data handling practices and comply with data privacy regulations.
